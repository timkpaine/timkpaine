            ## Background and Motivation

            This talk has three motivations:

            1. Explain some of the key architectural elements of Jupyter / JupyterLab (ContentsManager, Server Extensions, Frontend Extensions)
            <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

            2. Introduce `jupyter-fs`, its architecture and key features
            <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

            3. Show how you can use `jupyter-fs` to reduce friction in your data science workflows
            <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

            ---

            ## Background

            Jupyter is the tool of choice for researchers and data scientists
            <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->

            ---

            ---

            In a typical setup, we'll have access to some compute and storage

            ---

            ---

            When exploring some new data or conducting an experiment for the first time, a typical workflow might look like this:

            ---

            TODO diagram here

            ---

            This workflow is very common, but has friction points and requires navigating across tools

            Users often prefer to have an all-in-one environment where they can access their data, code, and compute in one place

            Jupyter is perfect for code, dispatching to compute, and accessing data, but suffers a bit when it comes to browsing and exploring data backends

            ---

            This is where `jupyter-fs` comes in!

            ---

            What is `jupyter-fs`, what does it do, and how do I use it?

            ---

            `jupyter-fs` is a:

            - Jupyter `ContentsManager`
            - Jupyter Server Extension
            - JupyterLab Frontend Extension

            ---

            Let's look at each of these aspects in turn


            ---

            ## `ContentsManager`

            A `ContentsManager` is a filesystem abstraction interface for Jupyter

            [Docs](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/contents.html)

            ---

            There are some simple methods to implement:

            - `get(path)`: Get a file or directory model.
            - `save(model, path)`: Save a file or directory model to path.
            - `delete_file(path)`: Delete the file or directory at path.
            - `rename_file(old_path, new_path)`: Rename a file or directory.

            etc

            ---

            There are three simple data structures to return:

            - Notebook: `.ipynb` file
            - File: text or binary file
            - Directory: folder of files

            ---

            The default `ContentsManager` is the `FileContentsManager` which interacts with the local filesystem

            We can override via Jupyter Configuration

            ```python
            c.NotebookApp.contents_manager_class = "jupyterfs.MetaManager"
            ```

            **jupyter_server_config.json**

            ```json
            {
              "ServerApp": {
                "contents_manager_class":
                  "jupyterfs.metamanager.MetaManager"
              }
            }
            ```


            ---

            Note: `jupyter-fs` should do this itself on install, but other plugins and frameworks like `jupytext` do as well and might conflict.

            ---

            `jupyter-fs` provides two `ContentsManager` implementations:

            `MetaManager` and `SyncMetaManager`

            ---

            More accurately, `MetaManager` is a bridge between Jupyter `ContentsManager` and a backend filesystem implemented in one of the two major Python filesystem libraries:

            `fsspec`

            `pyfilesystem2`

            ---

            ## Configuring backends

            Both pyfilesystem2 and fsspec backends can be configured via the settings menu in the JupyterLab UI,  or via server-side config fles

            ---

            ```json
            c.JupyterFs.resources = [{
              "name": "local_test",
              "url": "osfs:///Users/timkpaine/Developer"
            }]
            ```

            ---

            <img src="assets/img/jupyterfs2025/example1.png" width=600  />

            ---

            ## Server Extension

            Jupyter has a modular server architecture that allows for extensions.

            [Docs](https://jupyter-server.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developers/extensions.html)

            When we replace the default `ContentsManager`, we also need to add a server extension to serve up the configuration API and static frontend assets.

            ---

            **jupyter_server_config.d/jupyterfs.json**

            ```json
            {
              "ServerApp": {
                "jpserver_extensions": {
                  "jupyterfs.extension": true
                }
              }
            }
            ```

            Note: as before, `jupyter-fs` should do this itself on install, but other plugins and frameworks may conflict.

            ---

            ## Frontend Extension

            JupyterLab also has a modular frontend architecture that allows for extensions.

            [Docs](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extending/frontend_extensions.html)

            ---

            `jupyter-fs` provides a separate filesystem browser interface in the JupyterLab sidebar

            This is for a few reasons:
            - The default file browser uses a "paning" view which is sometimes inconvenient for browsing data
            - The default file browser scales poorly when you have more than several hundred files or folders
            - We wanted the ability to create multiple independent file browsers unique to each separate backend

            ---

            [tree-finder](https://github.com/tree-finder/tree-finder)

            Standalone JavaScript library for file browsers, built on [regular-table](https://github.com/finos/regular-table) for scalability (1000s of files/folders)

            ## Key Features and Usage

            At the most basic level, `jupyter-fs` could be considered a "drop in" UI replacement for the default Jupyter file browser

            <img src="assets/img/jupyterfs2025/openwith.png" width=700  />

            ---

            Double click, drag and drop, right click context menus, multi-select, keyboard shortcuts, etc

            ---

            However, when working with remote filesystems, there are some additional features that can be very useful, as well as one substantial downside

            ---

            ## Elephant in the room

            Your notebook and the data you're viewing might not be colocated!

            Opening a notebook from a remote filesystem will run the notebook **locally**, while saving the file **remotely**

            Thus, this is very much oriented towards workflows where the data is remote but the code/notebook is local

            ---

            ## Overcoming

            Because of this nuance, we have a system for easily connecting the data you see on the left hand side with the code you write in the notebook

            These are called *snippets*, and we ship many out of the box

            ---

            <img src="assets/img/jupyterfs2025/snippets.png" width=600  />

            ---

            Snippets are registered, templated code blocks that can be copy-pasted into your notebook

            When done, they will be templated with the required parameters to access the data via the filesystem interface

            ---

            <img src="assets/img/jupyterfs2025/snippets2.png" width=800  />

            ---

            We can even access the pyfilesystem2 or fsspec filesystem object directly if we want to do something more custom

            <img src="assets/img/jupyterfs2025/snippets3.png" width=800  />


            ---

            ## Flexible Configuration

            Extensions can be configured server side or client side, allowing them to be stored across users or specific to an individual

            ---

            ## Authentication

            Similarly, authentication can be configured to pick up environment variables, or prompt the user to input fields

            ---

            ## Extensible ecosystem

            Thanks to the underlying filesystem libraries, we can support a wide variety of backends

            Users can even provide their own custom filesystem implementations, and there's no reason the underlying system needs to be filesystem-like
